# UnSupervised_ML_Zomato_Restaurant_Clustering_and_Sentiment_Analysis_capstone_project

This project focused on leveraging advanced data analytics techniques to gain meaningful insights into restaurants and customer feedback on the popular online food delivery platform, Zomato.

The dataset included details such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, average costs for two, ratings, and user reviews.

The first step involved data cleaning and preprocessing, which included removing duplicate entries, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis.

Next, I implemented clustering on the restaurant data using the k-means algorithm. The goal was to group similar restaurants and uncover patterns in the data. Key features for clustering included location, cuisines, and average cost for two. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method.
